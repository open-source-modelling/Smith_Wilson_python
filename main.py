# Smith & Wilson algorithm

""" Smith & Wilson is a widely used algorithm that can do both interpolation and 
 extrapolation of rates at the same time. This implementation is based on the 
 Technical documentation published by EIOPA and used to derive the risk-free interest 
 rate term structure (Version published on 12/09/2019).
"""
## This example

""" The example is taken from EIOPA's own Excel implementation tool (_Smith-Wilson 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate Extrapolation Tool 27102015.xlsb_). In this example we 
 have observed the zero-cupon bond rates for bonds maturing in 1 year, 2 years, ... 20 years.
 We are interested in extrapolating the curve for up to 65 years.
 To make the code more readable, numpy is used for matrix multiplication.

M_Target = np.transpose(np.arange(1,66)) # For which maturities do we want the SW algorithm to calculate the rates. In this case, for every year up to 65.

## Implementation

""" The vector "expected" contains the values from the Excel implementation released
